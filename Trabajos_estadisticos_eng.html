    <h2> My researchs </h2>


  <p> I decided to use this site to show a resume of my last researchs, made using different programs.</br>
      Most of them were made with public datasets shared by different argentinian institutions. </p>
  

      <h2> Work market in Santa Cruz </h2>
      <p> One of my first projects as a Social Sciences researcher was about the work market in the province of Santa Cruz, where i was born. The plots and maps that follow are just a part of this research about the economy of the province (that includes production, exports, demographic growing).
          Santa Cruz is the second province in extension of Argentina and is the most depopulated of them (less than 2 inhabitants per km2). Despite this, it had a large population growth in the last years and has also many economic activities. In the next map you can see the most important economic sectors of the province and their geographic location. The map was made with QGIS. In red you can see the oil wells, while in the yellow and white circles you can see the gold and plate mines. The big grey circles are the cities, showing with their size their population. In green are marked the protected areas and in light blue the hidroelectric dums that are being constructed in the Santa Cruz river. <br/>
      </p>
      <img class="datos" src="Actividades_Santa_Cruz2.png" height = 340 width=450/><br/>
      <p>
          The next plots were made with Excel. This one allow us to see the growth of the job positions in the private sector in the last years. 
      </p>
      <img class="datos" src="Mercado_trabajo_total.png" height = 360 width=450/><br/>
      <p>The quantity of jobs grew in the period 2003-2015, but then started to dicrease. The next plot shows us which were the sectors where the jobs were created.</p><br/>
      <img class="datos" src="Mercado_trabajo.png" height = 360 width=450/><br/>
      <p> As we can see, the sectors that grew the most were "services", "oil and mining" and "commerce". The growing of the "services" is because includes many activities, as education, transportation or tourism.</p>
    

      <h2> Visitors at Los Glaciares National Park </h2> 
      <p> El Calafate, the city where i was born, is one of the most important turistic destinations of the country, and is located at the south west of the Santa Cruz province. That's why i decided to do a research about the evolution of the visitors of Los Glaciares National Park, the main attractive of the region. As we can see in the following plot, the average of foreign visitors is really important. <br/></p>    
      <img class="datos" src="Visitantes_PNLG.png" height = 300 width=450/><br/>
      <p> But despite the continous growing of the visitors arrivals, the development of the region has a problem: the "seasonality" of the the touristic season. As we can see, there is a really big difference between the arrivals in summer (november, december, january, february) and in winter.<br/></p>
      <img class="datos" src="Promedio_PNLG.png" height = 300 width=450/><br/>
    
      <p> This is an historical problem of the city and in the last years there had been many proposals to solve it. </p>
        

    <h2> Public bicicles use in Buenos Aires (2021) </h2>

  <p> In a course about the big data analysis with R we did a research about the use of the public bike system of Buenos Aires.<br/>
      The difficulty was that the csv file that had the information had more than one million lines: one line for each personal use of the bikes.
      The idea was discovering which was the time and day in which the bikes were more used. The results are the following.
  </p>
  <img class="datos" src="bicicletas.png" height = 300 width=450/><br/>
  <img class="datos" src="Bicicletas2.png" height = 300 width=450/><br/>
  <p> As we can see in the plots the bikes were more used on fridays and in the afternoon, between 5 and 6 PM.  But when we calcultate de average of time that the people used the bikes, we can see that they were used more time on saturdays and sundays (25 and 27 minutes on average) while the other days of the week do not arrive to an average of 20 minutes. <br/>
    <img class="datos" src="Promedio_bicis.png" height = 300 width=450/><br/>
    Probably this is related to the use that people does of the bikes: while on weekdays most of the people uses the bike to go to work, on weekends they tend to use it more time for recreative activities.<br/>
  </p>
  
  
  <h2> Crimes in Argentina </h2>
  <p> Looking for csv files to practice i found an open file about crimes in Argentina in the last years.
      The file is reaally interesting because it has information about the 24 provinces of Argentina. That's why i decided to make a quantitative research about the evolution of the most common crimes in Argentina.<br/>
      One thing thet shocked me was the growing of the sexual crimes. To allow me to  compare the evolution of the last years i reagrupped the provinces into regions,<br/>
      As we can see, the rapes and other sexual crimes grew up in all the regions.
  </p>
  <img class="datos" src="delitossexuales.png" height = 450 width=450/><br/>
  <p> The dataset also allowed us to see the number of other "situations" (here counted as "crimes") as suicides and car accidents.</br>
      As we can see in the plot, the tendency depends on the region. While some regions tend to increase their numbers, some others are stable and others tend to descend. </p>

  <h2> Some maps: poverty and minery </h2>
  <p>Also in the university i did a QGIS course. QGIS is a program that allows to create and process geographically referenced information.<br/>
     For the final work i decided to make a map about the geographical distribution of poverty in Buenos Aires city relationing it with a layer about "popular neighborhoods".
     The main object of the research was to discover which was the spacial distribution of poverty and if it was related to this type of neighborhoods.<br/> 
     As we can see poverty tends to concentrate in the south east of the city, generally close to this kind of neighborhoods.
  </p>

  <p> The map that follows is about minery in Argentina.<br/>
      Tha map allow us to see the distribution of the mines and which is their principal product.</p>
  <img class="datos" src="Mineria.jpg" height = 400 width=450/><br/>
